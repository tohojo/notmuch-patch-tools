* Notmuch patch extraction and filtering tools

This repo contains some scripts for extracting patch series from a notmuch mail
store, and processing them in various ways.

Currently, the scripts included are:

- =notmuch-extract-patch-mbox.py=: Extracts a patch series from a thread and
  saves it in an mbox file, which can subsequently be applied using =git am=.

- =notmuch-compare-patch-series.py=: Compares a patch series containing
  backports with the upstream commits each patch refers to. Points out
  hunk-by-hunk differences in the backported patch, and also suggests possible
  follow-on fixes from upstream by looking at the git log of the files each
  patch touches.
